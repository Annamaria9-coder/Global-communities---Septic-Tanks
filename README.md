# Global-communities---Septic-Tanks

**Septic Tank Design Software
**

**Overview
**

This project is a software tool designed to help engineers and community members calculate the optimal septic tank size, material requirements, and cost estimates based on input data such as population size, waste production, seasonal variations, and locally available materials. It aims to provide a sustainable solution for communities without access to centralized sewer systems, ensuring proper sanitation management at an affordable cost.

Features

	•	Septic Tank Size Calculation: Automatically calculate the appropriate size of the septic tank based on waste output, population size, and retention time.
	•	Material Requirements: Estimate the quantity of locally sourced materials required for construction.
	•	Cost Estimation: Provide cost estimates based on material volume and local pricing.
	•	Seasonal Variations: Adjust calculations for seasonal changes, such as increased water flow during rainy seasons.
	•	Customizable Inputs: Users can input or select local materials and prices to generate accurate estimates.

Getting Started

To get started with the Septic Tank Design Software, clone this repository to your local machine and follow the installation instructions below.

Prerequisites

	•	Python 3.8+
	•	Recommended: A virtual environment tool like venv or virtualenv.

Installation

	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/septic-tank-design-software.git
cd septic-tank-design-software


	2.	Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate


	3.	Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt



Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can run the program and input the necessary parameters to calculate the septic tank size, material requirements, and cost.

Running the Program

python main.py

Input Parameters

You will be prompted to enter the following values:

	•	Population size: The number of people the septic tank will serve.
	•	Average waste per person per day: The average waste output per person.
	•	Retention time: How long the waste should stay in the tank for decomposition.
	•	Seasonal adjustments: Additional water input during rainy seasons (optional).
	•	Material selection: Choose from a list of locally available materials for construction.
	•	Material cost: Input the cost per unit of material (in local currency).

The program will then calculate:

	•	Septic tank size (in cubic meters).
	•	Volume of materials needed (e.g., cubic meters of concrete, bricks, etc.).
	•	Estimated total cost based on material quantity and unit price.

Input Parameters

Parameter	Description
Population Size	Number of people served by the septic tank.
Average Waste per Person	Average waste output per person per day (in liters).
Retention Time	Duration the waste stays in the tank for proper decomposition.
Seasonal Variation	Extra water flow during rainy seasons (optional).
Material Type	Select the material for construction (e.g., concrete, bricks).
Material Cost	Input the cost of the selected material per unit.
